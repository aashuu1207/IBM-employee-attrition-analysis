# IBM-employee-attrition-analysis

The objective of my project is to analyze the IBM Employees Attrition dataset and build a predictive model that can assist the company in identifying employees at high risk of leaving. By understanding the factors influencing attrition, IBM can take proactive measures to improve employee retention.
I collected a comprehensive dataset containing information about IBM employees, including demographic data, job-related factors, and satisfaction levels. The dataset is carefully curated to represent a diverse range of employees across various departments and positions.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Before building our predictive model, I conducted EDA to gain insights into the dataset. I explored various factors such as age, gender, job satisfaction, salary, and work-life balance to understand their relationship with attrition.
Based on EDA, I identified the most influential features that affect attrition. These features include job satisfaction, work-life balance, salary, years of experience, and performance ratings. I also performed feature engineering to create new variables that could potentially improve our model's accuracy.
I evaluated several machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting. After careful evaluation, selected the random forest algorithm as our predictive model. split the dataset into training and testing sets and trained the model on the training data.
To assess the performance of our predictive model, used various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. model achieved an accuracy of 87% on the AdaBoost algorithm , indicating its effectiveness in predicting employee attrition.
Through my analysis, I discovered that job satisfaction and work-life balance are the most significant factors contributing to attrition. Employees with lower job satisfaction and poor work-life balance are more likely to leave the company. Other important factors include salary, years of experience, and performance ratings. 

Based on findings, I suggest the following recommendations to reduce attrition rates:
- Focus on improving job satisfaction and work-life balance through targeted interventions and policies.
- Conduct regular salary reviews to ensure competitive compensation.
- Provide growth opportunities and career development programs to retain experienced employees.
- Foster a positive work environment that promotes employee engagement and reduces stress.
In conclusion, this predictive analysis model provides valuable insights into IBM employees' attrition and enables proactive measures to be taken to retain valuable talent. By leveraging the identified factors and recommendations, IBM can enhance employee satisfaction, reduce attrition, and create a thriving work environment.
